# PasswordChecker
A simple password strength checker.

This program allows the user to input their password and test the strength on a scale of very weak, weak, and strong, based on the number of characters, use of lower and uppercase letters, use of digits, and use of special characters. The password must be at least 14 characters long and use at least one from each category to be considered strong.

Run the program by typing "python3 password_strength_checker.py".

This tool is very basic and not intended to be implemented into any website to handle authentication; it is for educational use only and should not be used to secure personal or sensitive information. Please use as a learning tool only. 

While the program can generally be used to check the strength of a password, it doesn't teach the user about more important ways to protect their information with passwords. If this is the only tool someone uses to strengthen their password, they overlook thigns like not repeating passwords or using common words or sequences of characters, like "mysecureP@ssw0rd." If people use this program and see "your password is strong," they might be give a false sense of confidence and security. Since this is open-source, if this code were adopted by other websites, and it's obvious that this code is used, people with malicious intentions might take advantage of this fact and know exactly what types of passwords to check.
